<i>Disclaimer: </i><i>Never completely rely on any technology in life threatening circumstances. The following tools can be useful in many situations, but they are not completely foolproof. To give an extreme example, there's no point encrypting your hard drive with a super long password if you're going to be physically assaulted until you reveal it. Be safe, be careful and know what you're up against. This approach is called <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat-model" target="_blank">Threat Modelling</a>. </i>

<strong>PGP/GPG</strong>

You may often hear about PGP (also confusingly known as GPG) which is a type of  encryption often used in conjunction with email. Although versatile and robust, we believe this method of encrypting your communications is pretty difficult to use and easy to make critical mistakes with. Consequently, it should only be approached by determined users. Check out these guides for more info:

<strong>Tails</strong>

Tails is a live Linux distribution (meaning it runs in RAM does not require installation) commonly booted from a USB stick or SD card that provides a computing environment designed with the utmost security and privacy in mind. It comes pre-installed with a selection of useful software and all web traffic is routed through the Tor anonymity network.

Though this is a relatively advanced tool, Tails is as good as it gets when it comes to privacy enhancing software and is used by thousands around the world including journalists, activists and people just like you.

<strong>Signal Private Messenger</strong>
<div id="magicdomid122" class=""><span class="">Signal represents one of the most effectively implemented and easy to use end to end encrypted communication applications</span><span class=""> available</span><span class=""> today. It provides end to end encrypted messages and calls over WiFi and Mobile Data, allowing you to communicate with anyone around the world and be assured that no one else apart from the intended recipient can read your messages.
</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid123" class=""></div>
<div id="magicdomid124" class=""><span class="">You can get set up on Signal in under a couple of minutes and it can be downloaded on the Google Play Store and iOS App Store. Search for "Signal Private messenger". Unlike other messaging apps that purport to be private such as the proprietary WhatsApp, Signal is non profit and its code is open to anyone and</span> has subsequently <span class="">been audited by leading security experts. This is known a privacy by design and not privacy by policy (such as we see with WhatsApp).
</span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">
<div class=""><em>Note: Ironically WhatsApp has made moves to implement the TextSecure encryption protocol behind Signal into their application. Queerzone3000 cannot recommend WhatsApp as it is not open source. Assume that if you're using WhatsApp, your messages can potentially be read by a third party (e.g. if Facebook received a court order). </em></div>

<strong>Cyanogen Mod</strong>

CyanogenMod is an after market firmware for a number of cell phones based on the open-source Android operating system. It offers features not found in the official Android based firmwares of vendors.
